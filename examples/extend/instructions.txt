This example show how to extend the existing source code of MATILDA.FT
It modifies the existing GroupRegion class to include additional type selection.
Modfied files are included in the folder. In order to compile them with the rest of the code:

1) Both files should be moved to the scr/ folder

2) group_new.cu should be included in the source list in the make files

3) The group factory file should include the constructor call for the new group.
   It should include the header file with #include "group_new.h"

    if (s1 == "new_group"){
		return new GroupNew(iss);
	}

   This enables the new group type to be called from the input script using new_group keyword
