This folder contains several read-to-go demonstration simulations that highlight some of the features of MATILDA.FT.

PARTICLE-BASED MODELS:
coacervate:
Particle-based simulation of the system considered in Riggleman, Kumar, and Fredrickson (J. Chem. Phys. 2012). This particular simulation is run at dimensionless excluded volume parameter B = 0.05 and dimensionless Bjerrum length E = 10000
.

dpd:
Runs a spinodal demixing simulation using the DPD thermostat.


dynamic-bonds:


lamella:
A 3D simulation of an A-B diblock copolymer with f = 0.5 and large chi*N. This system is randomly initialized and is expected to form a defective lamellar state.


model-A:
Particle-based implementation of the Gaussian-regularized Edwards model by Villet and Fredrickson (J. Chem. Phys. 2014). 


liquid-crystal:
Small liquid crystal system that ramps the Maier-Saupe parameter from 5 to 120. The mesogens are discretized into three interaction sites with the Maier-Saupe potential acting on the center. This simulation should exhibit both an isotropic-nematic transition and a nematic-smecticA transition.



FIELD-THEORETIC SIMULATIONS
ft:
Calculates the equilibrium structure of an A-B homopolymer blend at chi*N = 3.5. The system is initialized to a sine wave potential profile.
